        <h2>The intellectual.</h2>
        <p>P. V. Narasimha Rao garu has never stopped learning through out his life, Besides having an excellent command over his mother tongue Telugu, he was proficient in Marathi. He has translated Hari Narayan Apte’s famous Marathi novel Pan Lakshat Kon Gheto into Telugu.he was fluent in <b>16 languages</b> including six foreign tongues.Telegu,Marathi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Bengali, Hindi, Gujarati, Oriya,Tamil, Persian, Spanish, German, French, English and Arabic were the languages he spoke. <br>
        Apart from being multi linguistic , He was deeply interested in <strong>Indian philosophy and culture, and wrote poetry, fiction and political commentary</strong>. He has also published Sahasra Phan, a Hindi translation of Viswanatha Satyanarayana’s famous Telugu novel Veyi Padagalu and published many articles in different magazines, mostly under a pen name. He also published a 'semi-autobiographical' novel The Insider, which kicked up a storm in political circles. <br>
         A man of many interests, he also liked music, cinema and theatre. the voracious reader, also left behind a library with his collection of over 10,000 books in multiple languages, many of them rare editions. A library was set up by him at the Swami Ramananda Tirtha Trust in Begumpet in Andhra Pradesh.<br>
      His quest for learning did not restrict him to the language of books—he went on to far outpace his peers and introduced himself to the language of computers. He was in his 60s when he got his son to send him a computer, and hired a tutor to learn the intricacies of the machine in 1986. Rao eventually went on to write code in programming languages Basic, Cobol and Unix.<br>
      
      The computer became his companion till he breathed his last.members of Swami Ramananda Tirtha Trust said, “When doctors advised him to use a stress ball at the age of 80 to exercise his fingers, he used a keyboard and typed documents on the computer.”

        <h2> A Leader.</h2>
          <blockquote cite= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Narasimha_Rao">   
         <p> As the "first Prime Minister from South Indian", he was known to be an intellectual and is said to have brought a scholarly vision to the table. He is best remembered for having developed the ability to stay low profile and under difficult situations. He had the penchant for choosing silence when people around him desperately wanted him to make his views known as a leader. Many found it frustrating and criticised him for being indecisive, while others said the indecision was also a way of dealing with complicated issues.<br></p>
      <p>
          Mr. P. V. Narashimha Rao did not have the appeal of a mass leader. Where he lacked in charisma, he made up for abundantly in political shrewdness that helped him run a minority government for five years.<br>
      
      </p>
          <p>This great leader was not intimidated by anyone and was definitely not worried being overshaded by his cabinet ministers as he gave them freedom to take bold desicions which inturn resulted in a future that India couldn't have imagined that day.<br>
          </p><p>
          When he took over as the prime minister, the country was in deep economic crisis. The credit for opening up of the Indian economy and thereby reviving it and placing it on a growth trajectory goes to him as much to Manmohan Singh who, as the finance minister in Rao's cabinet, brought in liberalisation. Rao had to brave opposition to the reforms from not just the political opponents but also from within the party. He gave Manmohan the political cover to make the bold economic moves. <br>
          </p><p>
          It was also under his leadership that the Indian space programme got an impetus with the successful testing of the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) and the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)<br>
      </p><p>
      India also successfully tested the Prithvi missile to strengthen and enhance external security capability then, he had also asked late Dr APJ Abdul Kalam in 1996 to get ready for nuclear tests to take India to join a new league, which were later conducted by under the prime minister Vajpayee-led NDA Government in 1998<br></p><p>
        Another of his achievements was the handling of militancy in Punjab. He did not indulge in any grandstanding but quietly and steadfastly brought the state back on track electorally. The voting percentage was just over 20 per cent, and killings by militants increased. However, by the end of his term in 1996, Punjab was a much more peaceful place.<br>
      </p><p>
      The former prime minister's effectiveness also was due to his ability to reach out to leaders across the aisle. This was most evident in the manner in which he defeated Pakistan's bid to internationalise the Kashmir issue. Pakistan had tabled a resolution in the United Nations Human Rights Commission, and this came in the backdrop of the United States terming it a dispute. Rao formed a delegation led by his political opponent Atal Bihari Vajpayee. And in a bid to discredit Pakistan's accusations of persecution of Muslims in Kashmir, he packed the team with leaders such as Salman Khurshid, E. Ahamed, Farooq Abdullah and Hamid Ansari. Manmohan Singh, too, was sent to the UN to fight the diplomatic battle since he was held in high regard there.<br></p>
